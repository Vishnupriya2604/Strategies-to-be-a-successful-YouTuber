                        YouTube is now one of the major social network platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.
                        It is now a rising search engine for all topics a user is interested.
                        With over millions of subscribers, YouTube stars make profits not only by the views but also by
                        launching their own business on the YouTube platform. This project focuses on the strategies a
                        YouTuber has to take to become successful.

                <li>
                    <p>

                        The number of videos and subscribers is used in evaluating hotness and competitiveness of
                        videos.


                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>

                        The quickest response rate can be used when itâ€™s considered with the number of likes, dislikes,
                        and comments.


                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>

                        Title phrasing is essential, to get more views.
                        The time a video is published determines the success of the video.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>

                        Therefore, to be a successful YouTuber, having millions of subscribers is significant.
                        However, making videos that contains what people care about is as much important as the
                        numbers.
                        From the analysis and trends, we can figure out what people are interested in watching and how
                        one can brand a company based on these trends.
